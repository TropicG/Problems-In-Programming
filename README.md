Here you can find problems which we have covered in our classes and homeworks that have been given to us during the semester. The course had as a goal to teach us the basic principles to programming and making the students 'think' just like programmers do. 

Here is what we covered in this course:
- C++ syntax, variables
- std::cin and std::cout
- if else statements as well logic operators
- while, for, do while loops
- functions
- pointers and references
- dynamic memory and heap
- structures 

I will add soon and solution to the exercises given to us during our exam during the semester.
