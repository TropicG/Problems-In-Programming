Here you can find solutions to the problems in different chapters of the book "Problems in Programming". This book was recomended by our assistant and I decided to start solving the problems so I can sharpen my C++ skills.

Thought the book I covered these chapters:
- Chapter I: Introduction and basic examples
- Chapter II: Types and functions
- Chapter III: Loops, arrays and strings
- Chapter IV: Pointers and programming stack
- Chapter V: Recursion
- Chapter VI: Structs
- Chapter VII: Dynamic memory
- Chapter VIII: Templates
- Chapter IX: Classes I: basic classes, methods and operators
- Chapter X: Life cycles of the objects
